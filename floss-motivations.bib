  abstract	= {Companies, including market rivals, have long collaborated
		  on open source software (OSS) development, resulting in a
		  tangle of co-operation and competition known as "open
		  source co-opetition". While prior work investigates open
		  source co-opetition in OSS projects that are hosted by
		  vendor-neutral foundations, we have a limited understanding
		  thereof in OSS projects that are hosted and governed by one
		  company. Given their prevalence, it is timely to
		  investigate open source co-opetition in such contexts.
		  Towards this end, we conduct a mixed-methods analysis of
		  three company-hosted OSS projects in the artificial
		  intelligence (AI) industry: Meta's PyTorch prior to its
		  donation to the Linux Foundation, Google's TensorFlow, and
		  Hugging Face's Transformers. We contribute three key
		  findings. First, while the projects exhibit similar code
		  authorship patterns between host and external companies
		  (~80\%/20\% of commits), collaborations are structured
		  differently (e.g. decentralised vs. hub-and-spoke
		  networks). Second, host and external companies engage in
		  strategic, non-strategic, and contractual collaborations,
		  with varying incentives and collaboration practices. Some
		  of the observed collaborations are specific to the AI
		  industry (e.g. AI model integrations), while others are
		  typical of the broader software industry (e.g. bug fixing
		  or task outsourcing). Third, single-vendor governance
		  creates a power imbalance that influences open source
		  co-opetition practices and possibilities, from the host
		  company's singular decision-making power (e.g. the risk of
		  license changes) to their community involvement strategy
		  (e.g. from over-control to over-delegation). We conclude
		  with recommendations for future research.},

		  about 50\% of all open source software development has been
		  paid work for many years now and that many small projects
		  are fully paid for by companies. However, we also find that
		  any non-trivial project balances the amount of paid

  abstract	= {Open source software projects rely on the voluntary
		  efforts of thousands of software developers, yet we know
		  little about why developers choose to participate in this
		  collective development process. This paper inductively
		  derives a framework for understanding participation from
		  the perspective of the individual software developer based
		  on data from two software communities with different
		  governance structures. In both communities, a need for
		  software-related improvements drives initial participation.
		  The majority of participants leave the community once their
		  needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved.
		  For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and
		  participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical
		  to the long-term viability of the software code: They take
		  on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to
		  maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code.
		  Governance structures affect this evolution of motives.
		  Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid
		  strategies designed to combine the advantages of open
		  source software development with proprietary ownership and
		  control are discussed.},
