		  These organizational "cathedrals" are to be contrasted with

		  Projects, which have no pre-designed organizational

		  self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated.
		  Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do
		  expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within
		  the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and
		  their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS
		  projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold
		  important lessons for how commercial software teams might
		  be organized. Building on known well-established techniques
		  for detecting community structure in complex networks, we
		  extract and study latent subcommunities from the email
		  social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python,
		  PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them
		  with software development activity history. Our results
		  show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise
		  within these projects as the projects evolve. These
		  subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical
		  discussions, and are significantly connected with

  abstract	= {Context: On March 20, 2024, Redis Inc. changed the Redis
		  project’s license from the permissive Berkeley Software
		  Distribution (BSD) license to a dual licensing model under
		  the Redis Source Available License (RSALv2) and the Server
		  Side Public License (SSPLv1). The official rationale for
		  this change was to restrict cloud service providers from
		  offering Redis as a managed service without contributing
		  back. The license transition drew widespread attention
		  within the open source community and raised concerns from
		  some developers and organizations about its implications
		  for project governance, contribution dynamics, and
		  long-term sustainability. Objective: Analyze the
		  contribution distribution within the Redis repository by
		  examining the behavior of developers with different
		  motivations, evaluate the changes that occurred during the
		  license change period, and assess whether cloud providers
		  are exploiting the open-source project. Method: This study
		  categorizes developers’ motivations based on
		  collaboration behavior data. By leveraging developer
		  profile information, contributors are categorized into
		  three motivation types: company-driven, community-driven,
		  and communication-driven, enabling an analysis of trends
		  across different contributor groups. The study primarily
		  relies on project evaluation metrics from the Community
		  Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) community,
		  along with collaboration metrics, to examine changes within
		  the Redis repository. Results: Since 2017, cloud providers
		  have consistently contributed to the Redis open-source
		  project. During the license change period, there was a
		  notable decrease in contributor participation and
		  influence, particularly among company-driven and
		  community-driven developers. Several core contributors
		  transitioned to the newly established Valkey project.
		  Conclusion: Following the license change by Redis Inc., the
		  community experienced a certain degree of fragmentation,
		  with major cloud providers migrating to the Valkey fork.
		  Cloud providers have recognized the importance of the
		  community and are willing to invest resources into the
		  open-source projects they participate in, ensuring better
		  collaboration and alignment with upstream development for
		  their cloud services.},

		  forking represents the single greatest tool available for

		  addition to bolstering program sustainability, code forking
		  directly affects the governance of open source initiatives.
		  Forking, and even the mere possibility of forking code,
		  affects the governance and sustainability of open source
		  initiatives on three distinct levels: software, community,
		  and ecosystem. On the software level, the right to fork
		  makes planned obsolescence, versioning, vendor lock-in,
		  end-of-support issues, and similar initiatives all but
		  impossible to implement. On the community level, forking
		  impacts both sustainability and governance through the
		  power it grants the community to safeguard against
		  unfavourable actions by corporations or project leaders. On
		  the business-ecosystem level forking can serve as a
		  catalyst for innovation while simultaneously promoting
		  better quality software through natural selection. Thus,

		  In the case of free software, although forking is a

		  some light on the practice of forking. Therefore, we have
		  identified significant forks, several hundreds in total,

		  occurred, the reason of the fork, and the outcome of the
		  fork, i.e., if the original or the forking project are
		  still developed. Our investigation shows, among other
		  results, that forks occur in every software domain, that
